# Psychic-Game

### The idea of this game is for the user to guess which letter the computer chose.

There will be some basic info available onscreen:

*Wins: (# of times the user has guessed the letter correctly)

*Losses: (# of times the user has failed to guess the letter correctly after exhausting all guesses)

*Guesses Left: (# of guesses left. This will update)

*Your Guesses So Far: (the specific letters that the user typed. Display these until the user either wins or loses.)
